Cellphone Assassins game

This is an implementation of the nerf/marker/tag game that is played by organizations all over the somewhere.

Look up the rules if this game seems intresting.

Check the dev branch for the most recent commits.

I expect anyone who is using this to have a decent understanding of the code, support will be given if there is a decent reason for any contributer to give support.
